Generate an evaluation dataset for a prompt evaluation. The dataset will be used to evaluate AI outputs that generate Python, JSON, or Regex specifically for AWS-related tasks. Generate an array of JSON where each object is representing a task that requires Python, JSON, or a Regex to complete.

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "task": "Description of task",
    "answer": "optimal answer to the task"
  }
  // ... additional examples
]
```
